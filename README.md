Clicking on the Record Button starts the macro reader, which records all the interactions the user has with the desktop.

Clicks are stored as coordinates and also images of the icons/buttons. Coordinates are stored as fail-safe in case the image is not found.

By clicking the create code button, you can created a standalone python code that can execute the recorded steps. OR you can execute them through the UI itself.

For example in the above video, clicks are recorded and buttons are extracted :

Which are then used by the code to interact with the desktop.
